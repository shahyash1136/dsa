Subject: PI Approval and Estimated User Count for LMS Project

Dear Bala,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to bring to your attention the latest Process Improvement (PI) I have implemented for the LMS project. The PI focuses on optimizing the performance by converting SVG images to font icons using IcoMoon. This improvement significantly reduces the number of server requests, thereby enhancing the loading speed and overall user experience. A detailed document outlining the process and benefits has been attached for your review.

Could you kindly review the attached document and provide your approval for the implementation? Additionally, it would be helpful if you could share the approximate number of users who will be accessing the application, as this information is crucial for our performance testing and scaling considerations.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
